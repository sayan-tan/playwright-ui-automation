## üìñ Introduction
This repository contains a Test Automation Framework built using Playwright and Javascript for automated testing of web applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- [![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.16.1 or higher recommended)
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-CB3837?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white)](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v9.5.1 or higher recommended)

[![Chromium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chromium-4A90E2?style=for-the-badge&logo=chromium&logoColor=white)](https://www.chromium.org/Home)


  ```bash
  npm run tests:CHROME
  ```
  ```bash
  npm run tests:EDGE
  ```
  ```bash
  npm run tests:FIREFOX
  ```
  ```bash
  npm run tests:WEBKIT
  ```
  ```bash
  npm run tests:CHROMIUM
  ```

- Execution in Headless mode:
  ```bash
  npm run tests:CHROME:HEADLESS
  ```

## üìÅ Project Structure

The tests follow a modular and maintainable structure:

```
|-- .github
|     |-- workflows
|          |-- 01_ui_tests_chrome.yml
|          |-- 02_ui_tests_select_one.yml.yml
|          |-- 03_ui_tests_ALL.yml
|-- pages
|     |-- BasePage.js
|     |-- CartPage.js
|     |-- Components.js
|     |-- LoginPage.js
|     |-- ProductsPage.js
|-- test-data
|     |-- login_credentials.json
|-- tests-saucedemo
|     |-- components.spec.js
|     |-- login.spec.js
|-- utils
|     |-- VerificationUtils.js
|     |-- WaitUtils.js
|-- .gitignore
|-- package.json
|-- playwright.config.js
```

- `pages`: Contains the Page Object Model (POM) classes representing web pages and their elements.
- `playwright-report`: Contains the HTML report for tests (Logs, Screenshots, Traces, and Videos are attached).
- `test-data`: Contains external files (example: login credentials data) that can be used to mock data during tests.
- `tests-saucedemo`: Contains the actual test files. You can organize your tests into subdirectories as needed. 
- `utils`: Contains the Utilities that provide methods for asserting different conditions on web elements, and waits.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- Modify `playwright.config.js` for playwright configuration settings such as
  - `baseURL`
  - `testDir`
  - `reporter`
  - `fullyParallel`
  - `video`
  - `screenshot`
  - `trace`

## üîÑ Continuous Integration

This project is configured for CI using GitHub Actions. Check the configurations in `.github/workflows/*.yml`.

- `01_ui_tests_chrome.yml`: This workflow executes tests in the Chrome browser.

- `02_ui_tests_select_one.yml`: This workflow will first ask the User to select the browser for test execution.

- `03_ui_tests_ALL.yml`: This workflow executes the tests in all browsers <!-- #(CHROME, EDGE, WEBKIT, CHROMIUM, FIREFOX) -->
